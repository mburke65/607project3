## Functions

+ I wanted to avoid using the two functions directly, but it made life really easy specifically Choosemultiple
+ I can't contact her on kaggle becuase I am not a contributor, if someone is can they can send her a message?
+ [kaggel contact info](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/contact)

```{r}




## Takes a column and creates summary without nulls containing N sum and proportions
chooseOne = function(question){
    exp_df %>%
        filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>% 
        dplyr::group_by_(question) %>% 
    # Count how many respondents selected each option
        dplyr::summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    # Calculate what percent of respondents selected each option
        dplyr::mutate(percent = (count / sum(count)) * 100) %>% 
    # Arrange the counts in descending order
        dplyr::arrange(desc(count)) 
}

## Same as Choose one except works for answers where user could choose multiple answers per question
chooseMultiple = function(question,df){

  df %>% 
    # Remove any rows where the respondent didn't answer the question
    dplyr::filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>%
    # Remove all columns except question
    dplyr::select(question) %>% 
    # Add a column with the initial number of respondents to question
    dplyr::mutate(totalCount = n()) %>% 
    # Split multiple answers apart at the comma, but ignore commas inside parentheses
    dplyr::mutate(selections = strsplit(as.character(UQ(sym(question))), 
                                 '\\([^)]+,(*SKIP)(*FAIL)|,\\s*', perl = TRUE)) %>%
    # Split answers are now nested, need to unnest them
    unnest(selections) %>% 
    # Group by the selected responses to the question
    dplyr::group_by(selections) %>% 
   # Count how many respondents selected each option
    dplyr::summarise(totalCount = max(totalCount),
              count = n()) %>% 
    # Calculate what percent of respondents selected each option
    dplyr::mutate(percent = (count / totalCount) * 100) %>% 
    # Arrange the counts in descending order
    dplyr::arrange(desc(count))
}        


## Slight modification to choosone,
Academic_exploration=function(question,df){
     df %>%
        filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>% 
        dplyr::group_by_(question) %>% 
    # Count how many respondents selected each option
        dplyr::summarise(count = n()) %>% 
    # Calculate what percent of respondents selected each option
        dplyr::mutate(percent = (count / sum(count)) * 100) %>% 
    # Arrange the counts in descending order
        dplyr::arrange(desc(count)) 
}



## Takes a vector and creates a percantage column
proportion_function <- function(vec){
    vec/sum(vec)*100
}

##Creates intervals for column data, that matches intervals to foreign data intervals 

create_breaks <- function(dfcolumn,breaks,labels)
    {
    dfcolumn <- as.numeric(dfcolumn)
    dfcolumn <- cut(dfcolumn,breaks=breaks,labels=labels,right=FALSE)
    }


##Failed funnction
#identity_plots_45 <- function(df,x,y,fill){ggplot(df, aes(x = var(x),y=var(y), fill = var(fill))) + 
 #     geom_bar(stat="identity")+
#}
```

## Load in data and create summaries for all the columns with functional
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
raw.data <- read_csv('C:/Users/justin/Documents/GitHub/607project3/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', na=c('')) %>%
  subset(DataScienceIdentitySelect == 'Yes' & CodeWriter == 'Yes') %>%
  rowid_to_column('id') 
exp_df <- raw.data%>%
    select(c(1:5,10,11,59,12,56,57,58,60,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,207,208,209)) 
exp_df <- as_data_frame(exp_df)  

## Data exploration-Preview Column summaries
#my_names <- colnames(exp_df)
#lapply(my_names,function(x)chooseOne(x))
#colnames(exp_df)

##TimeSpentStudying didnt load,ProveKnowledgeSelect
raw.data[,c(53,54)]
```

## How did you first learn machine learning
```{r,echo=FALSE}
FirstTrained <- chooseOne("FirstTrainingSelect")
FirstTrained
FirstTrained$FirstTrainingSelect <- factor(FirstTrained$FirstTrainingSelect, levels = FirstTrained$FirstTrainingSelect)

ggplot(FirstTrained, aes(x = FirstTrainingSelect,y=percent, fill = FirstTrainingSelect)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity")+
      theme(legend.position="none")+
    coord_flip()
```

## Takeaway
+ Only 8% of data scientists went into their job with no knowledge of Machine Learning
+ Over 50% of data scientists learned by themselves or through online courses
+ Over 34% of data scientists first learned ML through university



## How important is university?
```{r,echo=FALSE}
Importance <- chooseOne('UniversityImportance')
Importance <- Importance %>% 
    filter(UniversityImportance %in% c(c("Very important","Important","Somewhat important","Not very important","Not at all important" )))
Importance$UniversityImportance <- factor(Importance$UniversityImportance, levels = Importance$UniversityImportance)
ggplot(Importance, aes(x = UniversityImportance,y=percent, fill = UniversityImportance)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity")+
      theme(legend.position="none")

```


## Takeaways
+ less than 10% of data scientists feel Advanced degrees are unimportant

## Education data

```{r,echo=FALSE}
education <- chooseOne('FormalEducation')
other_count <- sum(education[4:7,]$count)
other_percent <- sum(education[4:7,]$percent)
Other <- c("Other",other_count,other_percent)

#Combine other degrees into other category becuase I will show comparable data with those categories to validate our dataset
education <- education %>% 
    filter(FormalEducation%in% c("Master's degree","Doctoral degree","Bachelor's degree")) %>% 
    rbind(.,Other)  
education[,2:3] <- sapply(education[,2:3], as.numeric) 
ggplot(education, aes(x = FormalEducation,y=percent, fill = FormalEducation)) + 
      geom_bar(stat="identity")+
      theme(legend.position="none")
```

```

## Takeaways

+ Computer Science leads the field with over 30%

+ Close behind is math and stat followed by Electrical engineering

+ About 6.5% of data scientists come from social science backgrounds

## What are the Gender and Age demographics

```{r,echo=FALSE}

+ "By maintaining such strong relationships with candidates and clients, Burtch Works has the unique opportunity to examine hiring and compensation trends over time, and publishes several highly-anticipated studies each year that investigate demographic and compensation data for predictive analytics, marketing research, and data science professionals. The Burtch Works Studies provide an exceptional vantage point on compensation for these professionals across the country, and contain critical information both for individuals mapping their career strategy, and for hiring managers hoping to recruit and retain outstanding personnel to their teams."

## Takeaways
+ Only about 18% of data scientists are over 47 years old
+ There are as many 18-22 year old as there are 62+
+ 23-38 encompasses nearly 60% of the field
+ There is an enormous gender bias in the composition of Males/Females with males outnumbering females at nearly 4-1

## Comparing the datasets

## Explore Employment Status and see how it effects remote login statistics
```{r,echo=FALSE}
chooseOne('EmploymentStatus')
Employment_Remote_Work <- exp_df %>%

grid.arrange(remotely_graph_1,remotely_graph_2,remotely_graph_3, top="Data scientists working remotely by employment status")

```


## Takeaways
+ Unsurprisingly people working independently seem to work remotely w over 50% of those employed this way always working remotely
+ Full time employees don't work remotely all that much.   Over 35% of them Rarely work remotely, and very few almost always work remotely
+ Part time employees seem pretty evenly split

## Employer catagories
```{r,echo=FALSE}
# EmployerIndustry- which industry are you in
# EmployerSize-size

# EmployerMLTime- how many years has your company been deploying ML
# EmployerSearchMethod- how did you dfind your job
employ <- names(exp_df[,10:16])
lapply(employ,function(x)chooseOne(x))



## First create graph of industry wide employment
EmployerIndustries <- chooseOne("EmployerIndustry") 
EmployerIndustries$EmployerIndustry<- factor(EmployerIndustries$EmployerIndustry, levels=EmployerIndustries$EmployerIndustry)
EmployerIndustries %>% 
    filter(EmployerIndustry%in%c("Academic", "Technology", "Financial", "Other", "Mix of fields", "Internet-based", "Government", "Manufacturing", "CRM/Marketing", "Insurance", "Retail", "Pharmaceutical", "Non-profit", "Military/Security", "Hospitality/Entertainment/Sports")) %>%

      geom_bar(stat="identity")+
      theme(legend.position="none")+

```



## Use top employment industries (Academic Financial Government Technology)

## Create function to map a grid of our subsetted data
```{r}
### Someone get me a function here to create factor of 1st column!!!
### Also one for ggplot if possible?




## Explore subset but first create function

      coord_flip()

   
 grid.arrange(plot_1,plot_2,plot_3,plot_4, top=paste("Data scientists employed in",field))
